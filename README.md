# ğŸ‘‹Hi 
Back in **2022** I wanted to learn more about asset creation. Because I liked the idea of vector graphics, I looked into ways to build multiple assetsÂ from a single definition.
As of now, I've simply experimented with it by generating different hue values and created an image from them.

# ğŸ”ŒPossibility of Extending
This also inspired me to try itÂ withÂ a grammar someday,Â but that's a project for another day.

# ğŸ“” Usage
`npm install`

`npm run dev`
